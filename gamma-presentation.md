# Executive Summary

## Current State Assessment

Your organization operates at a **foundational digital maturity level (2/5)** with strong existing Microsoft infrastructure but significant gaps in information discoverability, KPI tracking, and onboarding efficiency.

Despite having advanced tools like Salesforce, Power BI, and RPA capabilities, the technology is **underutilized** due to resistance to change and lack of citizen developer champions.

### Maturity Scores by Pillar
