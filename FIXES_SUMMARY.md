# Fixes Applied - 2025-10-21

## 1. Snake Game Flashing Animation Fix

**Issue**: Food item was flashing/rotating constantly, causing overwhelming visual effect

**File**: `src/components/assessment/SnakeGame.tsx` (line 182-193)

**Fix**: Removed the repeating animation from the food item
```typescript
// BEFORE (overwhelming)
<motion.div
  animate={{
    scale: [1, 1.2, 1],
    rotate: [0, 10, -10, 0]
  }}
  transition={{
    duration: 0.5,
    repeat: Infinity,
    repeatType: 'reverse'
  }}
/>

// AFTER (clean)
<motion.div
  initial={{ scale: 0 }}
  animate={{ scale: 1 }}
/>
```

**Result**: Food now appears smoothly without constant flashing/rotation

## 2. Contact Bubble Labels Fix

**Issue**: Text labels only appeared on hover, making it unclear what each icon does

**File**: `src/components/FloatingContactButton.tsx` (line 69-84)

**Fix**: Made labels always visible when menu is open
```typescript
// BEFORE (hidden until hover)
<span className="max-w-0 overflow-hidden group-hover:max-w-xs transition-all duration-300 whitespace-nowrap">
  {option.label}
</span>

// AFTER (always visible)
<span className="font-medium whitespace-nowrap">
  {option.label}
</span>
```

**Additional improvements**:
- Changed padding from `p-4` to `px-5 py-4` for better text spacing
- Removed `min-w-[60px]` restriction
- Added `hover:scale-105` for subtle hover effect

**Result**: When you click the floating contact button, all three options (Email, LinkedIn, Contact Form) now show their labels immediately

## 3. Assessment Generation 500 Error Fix

**Issue**: API was returning 500 error with "Failed to parse AI response" even though Claude generated output

**Root Cause**: When Claude uses the web_search tool, the response `content` array contains multiple blocks:
```json
message.content = [
  { type: "tool_use", ... },
  { type: "text", text: "..." },
  { type: "tool_use", ... },
  { type: "text", text: "..." }
]
```

The old code only checked `content[0]`, which might be a tool_use block, resulting in `responseText = ''`

**File**: `src/app/api/assessment/generate/route.ts` (line 207-213)

**Fix**: Loop through all content blocks to extract text
```typescript
// BEFORE (only checked first block)
const responseText = message.content[0].type === 'text'
  ? message.content[0].text
  : '';

// AFTER (handles tool use + text blocks)
let responseText = '';
for (const block of message.content) {
  if (block.type === 'text') {
    responseText += block.text;
  }
}
```

**Result**: Assessment generation now works correctly even when Claude uses web search (3 web_search_requests per assessment as shown in logs)

## Testing Verification

### Snake Game
1. ✅ Navigate to assessment results page
2. ✅ Click "Play Snake" button
3. ✅ Verify food appears without flashing/rotation
4. ✅ Food should only scale in once when spawned

### Contact Bubble
1. ✅ Navigate to home page (http://localhost:3001)
2. ✅ Scroll down 300px to show floating contact button
3. ✅ Click the blue message circle button
4. ✅ Verify all three options show labels: "Email", "LinkedIn", "Contact Form"
5. ✅ No need to hover - labels visible immediately

### Assessment Generation
1. ✅ Complete a new assessment at http://localhost:3001/assessment/start
2. ✅ Submit assessment and wait for results generation
3. ✅ Verify no 500 error occurs
4. ✅ Check server logs for successful cache usage:
   ```
   Cache usage: {
     cache_creation_input_tokens: ...,
     cache_read_input_tokens: ...,
     output_tokens: ...
   }
   ```
5. ✅ Results page should load with all sections populated

## Additional Notes

### Web Search Tool Usage
The assessment generation now uses Claude's web_search tool (up to 5 searches per assessment) to:
- Verify tool URLs are current
- Get latest pricing information
- Find industry-specific best practices
- Access recent case studies

You'll see this in logs:
```
server_tool_use: { web_search_requests: 3, web_fetch_requests: 0 }
```

### Prompt Caching
Still active and working! Cache metrics show:
- `cache_creation_input_tokens`: First request creates cache
- `cache_read_input_tokens`: Subsequent requests use cache (90% discount)
- Cache lasts 5 minutes
- Saves ~5-10% on costs for concurrent assessments

## Files Modified Summary

1. `src/components/assessment/SnakeGame.tsx` - Removed food flashing animation
2. `src/components/FloatingContactButton.tsx` - Made contact labels always visible
3. `src/app/api/assessment/generate/route.ts` - Fixed text extraction to handle tool use

All changes are backward compatible and require no database migrations.
