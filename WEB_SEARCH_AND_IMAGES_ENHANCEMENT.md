### Web Search Process

When generating content, Claude:

1. **Searches for Industry Data**
   ```
   "{Industry} digital transformation benchmarks 2024-2025"
   "digital maturity assessment industry average {Industry}"
   "{Industry} digital transformation ROI metrics"
   ```

2. **Finds Specific Pillar Information**
   ```
   "data strategy best practices {Industry}"
   "automation maturity benchmarks {Industry}"
   "AI integration case studies {Industry}"
   ```

3. **Researches Success Stories**
   ```
   "successful digital transformation {Industry}"
   "quick wins digital maturity improvement"
   ```

4. **Extracts Concrete Data**
   - Average maturity scores by industry
   - Top performer scores
   - Typical ROI percentages
   - Implementation timelines
   - Success metrics

### Image Search Process

For each slide type, the system:

1. **Receives Recommendations from Claude**
   ```json
   {
     "slideType": "data_strategy",
     "searchQuery": "data analytics dashboard visualization",
     "description": "Modern BI dashboard",
     "placement": "illustration"
   }
   ```

2. **Queries Unsplash API**
   - Searches for high-quality, professional images
   - Filters by orientation (landscape/square)
   - Selects best match

3. **Downloads and Embeds**
   - Downloads image as base64
   - Embeds in PowerPoint slide
   - Maintains aspect ratio and quality

## 🎨 New Slides Added

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Claude API (already configured)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx

# Unsplash API for images (OPTIONAL)
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
```

### Getting an Unsplash API Key (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Copy the "Access Key"
5. Add to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

**Note**: Images are optional. If no Unsplash key is configured, the presentation will still be created with industry insights but without images.

## 📋 Example Output

### Before (Original)
```
Current State: Organization operates at foundational level (2/5)
[Generic recommendations]
```

### Claude Prompt Enhancement

The prompt now:
1. Explicitly instructs Claude to use web search
2. Specifies what to search for (benchmarks, trends, case studies)
3. Requests specific data points and statistics
4. Asks for image recommendations
5. Requires source citations

### Image Integration

```typescript
// 1. Claude recommends images
imageRecommendations: [
  {
    slideType: "data_strategy",
    searchQuery: "data analytics dashboard",
    placement: "illustration"
  }
]

// 2. System searches Unsplash
const imageUrl = await searchAndDownloadImage(query, placement);

// 3. Downloads and converts to base64
const base64Image = await downloadImageAsBase64(imageUrl);

// 4. Embeds in PowerPoint
slide.addImage({
  data: base64Image,
  x: 6, y: 1.2, w: 3.5, h: 2.5
});
```

## 🚦 Testing

### Test the Enhanced Endpoint

```bash
# Test with a real assessment
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/assessment/{ASSESSMENT_ID}/export-pptx-enhanced" \
  --output enhanced_presentation.pptx

# Open and verify:
# - Industry insights slide is present
# - Benchmark comparisons show real data
# - Sources are cited
# - Images are embedded (if Unsplash configured)
# - Quick wins include industry examples
```

### Verify Web Search Results

Check the presentation for:
- [ ] Industry-specific trends (not generic)
- [ ] Concrete statistics with percentages
- [ ] Source citations (e.g., "Gartner 2024", "McKinsey Report")
- [ ] Realistic benchmark numbers
- [ ] Relevant success story examples

### Verify Images

Check that:
- [ ] Images are professional and relevant
- [ ] Each pillar has appropriate imagery
- [ ] Images don't overpower text content
- [ ] Image quality is high

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Better Web Search Results

1. **Specify Industry**: Always set `industry` in assessment data
   ```typescript
   {
     company_name: "Acme Corp",
     industry: "Manufacturing",  // Be specific!
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Use Current Data**: Claude searches for 2024-2025 data
   - Benchmarks reflect current market
   - Trends are up-to-date
   - ROI metrics are realistic

3. **Review Sources**: Claude cites sources - verify they're credible
   - Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester ✅
   - Industry associations ✅
   - Peer-reviewed research ✅

### For Better Images

1. **Configure Unsplash API**: Free tier includes 50 requests/hour
2. **Review Image Relevance**: Claude recommends contextual images
3. **Check Licensing**: All Unsplash photos are royalty-free

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Web Search
- Results depend on available public data
- Some industries may have less published research
- Benchmarks may vary by geography/company size

### Images
- Requires Unsplash API key (optional)
- Limited to royalty-free stock photos
- Cannot include proprietary/branded imagery

### Generation Time
- Web search adds ~5-10 seconds to generation
- Image downloads add ~3-5 seconds
- Total: 15-25 seconds (vs 10-15 without search)

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

If web search fails or returns no results:
- Claude generates reasonable estimates based on knowledge
- Presentation is still created successfully
- Industry insights section uses general best practices

If image search fails:
- Presentation created without images
- Slides remain text-based
- Visual design unaffected

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After implementing, you should see:
- ✅ **More Specific Content** - Industry-tailored recommendations
- ✅ **Better Credibility** - Real benchmarks with sources
- ✅ **Higher Engagement** - Professional imagery throughout
- ✅ **Actionable Insights** - Data-driven quick wins
- ✅ **Competitive Analysis** - Clear positioning vs industry

## 📞 Support

### Issue: No industry insights in presentation
**Fix**: Ensure Claude API has web search enabled (Sonnet 4 model)

### Issue: Generic benchmarks
**Fix**: Specify detailed `industry` in assessment data

### Issue: No images
**Fix**: Add `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to `.env.local`

### Issue: Slow generation
**Fix**: Normal - web search and images take 15-25 seconds total

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. ✅ Test with a real assessment
2. ✅ Review industry insights for accuracy
3. ✅ Add Unsplash API key for images (optional)
4. ✅ Update frontend button text to "Generating... (with industry research)"
5. ✅ Gather user feedback on enhanced content
